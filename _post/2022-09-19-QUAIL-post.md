--We propose a unified statistical framework, called QUAIL, for estimating genetic effects on the variability of quantitative traits and for prioritizing genetic variants involved in interactions. QUAIL constructs a quantile-integral phenotype that aggregates information from all quantile levels, makes no assumptions about the distribution of the phenotype, and accounts for confounding effects at both the trait level variability.
