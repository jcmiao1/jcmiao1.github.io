--We introduce a cross-population genetic risk prediction framework, called X-Wing, that (1) quantifies cross-population local genetic correlation (2) incorporates it as an annotation into a Bayesian framework which amplifies correlated SNP effects between populations through annotation-dependent statistical shrinkage (3) combines multiple population-specific PRS to further improve prediction accuracy while using GWAS summary data alone as input.
