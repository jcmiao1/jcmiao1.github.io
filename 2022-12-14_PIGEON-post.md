--We present a unified theory and framework, called PIGEON, for modeling polygenic GxE effects for complex traits. It allows us to define the estimands of interest and to establish the connection and distinction between different methods in GxE inference. Motivated by our theory, we have also developed an innovative approach to estimate GxE interactions using genome-wide summary data. It is unbiased, computationally efficient, robust to sample overlap, heteroscedasticity, and gene-environment correlation.
